You should be able to get this information from your router/switch, or running arp -a {IP address} from your pi.\r\n\r\n>Note: You will need to have set the S20 up already using the ios/android app.\r\n\r\nSet up python / flask on the Raspberry Pi:  \r\n`sudo apt-get install python-pip`    \r\n`sudo pip install flask`    \r\n\r\nClone the repo:  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/rootomatic/smartthings_orviboS20.git`    \r\n\r\nRun the server orvibo_server.py \r\n`sudo python orvibo_server.py`\r\n\r\n>Note: You should be aware that running the server as root is a security risk, and make the necessary access changes to this code to secure it, necessary to your requirements.\r\n",
